## Getting Started

This package relies on Dart [`package:analyzer`][] to format generated code.

It provides a unified way to use all of the featured generators. Currently
featuring:

1. **Assets generator.**
   Used for utilizing autocompletion of the native file structure.

2. **I18N generator.**
   Primarily used for utilizing autocompletion of the files with translations,
   but can also be used for any type of Dart code conversion from strings.

3. **Data Class generator.**
   Used for generating all-in-one Dart classes from provided class fields.

4. **Icon Fonts generator.**
   Used for real-time generation of a webfont from `.svg` files.
   Also utilizes autocompletion of the nested icons like an assets generator.

## Installation

This package is intended to support the development of Dart projects with
[`package:build_runner`][]. In general, put it under [dev_dependencies][] in
your [`pubspec.yaml`][].

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: any
  generators_lite:
```

Alternatively, you can use plain console commands to do all the same things.
Enable the package globally and use it as a console tool:

```ps
dart pub global activate generators_lite

generate <command> [arguments]
```

Or call the package directly:

```ps
dart run generators_lite:main <command> [arguments]
```

Command is pointing to a generator to be used and arguments are passed directly
to that generator. For example:

```ps
generate assets --import-path source/assets --export-path lib/assets.g.dart
generate i18n -i source/i18n -e lib/i18n.g.dart
generate models -i models.json -e lib/models.g.dart
generate icons -i source/icons -e lib/icons.g.dart
```

## Usage

This package is configured using a `build.yaml` file. See the
[`package:build_config`][] README for more information on this file.

To use all files under your current package and not only files in `lib`,
set `build.yaml` sources section as following. See also `Example` tab for a
complete example on `build.yaml` file.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./build.yaml
targets:
  $default:
    sources:
      include:
        - $package$
        - lib/$lib$
        - '**'
      exclude:
        - .dart_tool/**
```

> NOTE: Because of the limitations on the [`package:build_runner`][], there can
> only be one predefined generated file when using aggregate builders. So, in
> terms of straightforwardness, every generator generates only one single file.
> This behavior may change in the future.

To run the generator, you want to run the following command:

```ps
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

To make things even easier, you can also setup [VS Code task][vs-code-task-link]
for [`package:build_runner`][]. This task can also be automatically run if you
allow the `c` command.
See this example on `tasks.json` for a convenient way to setup such task.

```json
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "label": "build_runner",
      "command": "flutter",
      "args": [
        "pub",
        "run",
        "build_runner",
        "watch",
        "--delete-conflicting-outputs",
        "--low-resources-mode"
      ],
      "isBackground": true,
      "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "silent",
        "focus": false,
        "panel": "shared",
        "showReuseMessage": true,
        "clear": false
      },
      "problemMatcher": ["$dart-build_runner"],
      "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The rest of this section provides detailed instructions on how to use each
generator from this package.

### Assets Generator

All this generator does is migrate a file structure from the provided
`import_path` to the nested Dart classes.

By default it omits any extension in the file name, but if there are two or
more files with the same name and different extensions, the extensions are also
added to the group keys.

To use this generator, you also need to specify fetched assets in your
[`pubspec.yaml`][].

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/nested_folder/
```

The Assets generator may also have the following keys:

- **import_path**: The path that leads to the directory to migrate file
  structure from. Defaults to `assets`.
- **export_path**: The path that leads to the file that is being generated.
  Defaults to `lib/assets.g.dart`.
- **export_encoding**: The encoding used for writing the `.dart` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **base_name**: The name of the generated class. Defaults to `Assets`.
- **convert**: If the file names should be converted to
  [camel case][camel-case-link]. Disabling this option will prevent any changes
  to be made to the file names. Be certain to pass valid Dart names or the
  generation will be likely to fail. Defaults to `true`.

### I18N Generator

This generator grounds on an abstract locale, which extends a global abstract
base, just like it's nested groups. Optionally, each group can also be modified
in a default (unnamed) locale. If there is no default locale, the abstract
locale is automatically resolved with all locales provided.

Each locale can be accessed through initialized constant class instance, or
through the call to a special generated `Enum` values.

If `use_flutter` is true, the `I18NLocalizations` class is also generated,
providing a context-dependent interface to access current locale from Flutter
widgets. This also requires providing the localization delegate like so:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  supportedLocales: I18NLocale.values.map((final _) => _.locale),
  localizationsDelegates: const <LocalizationsDelegate<Object?>>[
    I18NLocalizations.delegate
  ],
)
```

Then, to access the current localization, you would simply write:

```dart
final I18N $ = I18NLocalizations.of(context);
```

To start, we need to mention a few points on groups:

1. Each group can be nested indefinitely using getters.
2. Each group entry can be a getter or a method, which is derived from the
   entry key itself. By default, all entries are getters, but if an entry key
   ends with brackets, it will be rendered as a method.
3. If a group entry is a method, it can have any amount of parameters specified.
   But it is important to match these parameters between locales, including the
   abstract one.
4. If a group entry key has a type specified, this type will override the
   possible automatically derived return type.
5. If a group entry value is multiline, it will be rendered within the function
   body. And because of that, it will require a return type specified.
6. If you want to access the parent group from within the nested group, you can
   do that by using the `$` key.

The algorithm for fetching files under `import_path` directory:

1. Treat the part in the file name after the last underscore as a locale.

   - If only one file name of all doesn't have an underscore it is treated as a
     part of an abstract locale and other ones are treated regularly.
   - If more than one file name doesn't have an underscore, all file names are
     treated as locales. And the one without name is treated as an abstract one.

2. Process the tree structure for each fetched locale, including abstract one.

   - If there is only one file for a locale at a directory, file's parent
     directories stay present, but the file name is omitted, and the grouping
     starts inside this file.
   - If there is more than one file for a locale at a directory, file's parent
     directories, as well as the name of the file, stay present, and grouping
     starts one layer up from inside of the file.

3. Check that all of the locales match keys, including abstract one.

   - There is an error thrown, if actual locale has keys that neither the other
     locales have, nor the abstract one.
   - The keys, that are not present in the abstract locale, are automatically
     resolved from the actual locales and added as abstract getters.

4. Check the returning types in the abstract locale.
   - Each locale can have its own returning types for group getters, but the
     abstract locale will always be [covariant](variance-link).

The I18N generator may also have the following keys:

- **import_path**: The path that leads to the directory with localizations to
  be generated. Defaults to `i18n`.
- **export_path**: The path that leads to the file that is being generated.
  Defaults to `lib/i18n.g.dart`.
- **export_encoding**: The encoding used for writing the `.dart` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **encoding**: The encoding used for reading the `.json` and `.yaml` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **base_name**: The name of the generated class. Defaults to `I18N`.
- **convert**: If the group keys should be converted to
  [camel case][camel-case-link]. Disabling this option will prevent any changes
  to be made to the key names. Be certain to pass valid Dart names or the
  generation will be likely to fail. Defaults to `true`.
- **only_language_code**: Ensure that locales should only use their language
  codes. Defaults to `true`.
- **base_class_name**: The name of the class, that will be used as an abstract
  base for generated groups. You may also specify any necessary `imports`
  needed to import that class. Defaults to null.
- **enum_class_name**: The name of the generated `Enum`.
  Defaults to `I18NLocale`.
- **use_flutter**: If the generated results are intended to be used with
  Flutter. Thus, whether Localizations class and it's Localizations Delegate
  should be generated. Defaults to `true`.
- **localizations_class_name**: The name of the I18N Localizations class
  implementation. Only used if `use_flutter` is true.
  Defaults to `I18NLocalizations`.
- **delegate_class_name**: The name of the Localizations Delegate class
  implementation. Only used if `use_flutter` is true.
  Defaults to `I18NDelegate`.
- **delegate_fallback_locale**: The locale that will be used as a fallback in
  Localizations Delegate. Should be the exact match of one of the generated
  locales. Only used if `use_flutter` is true.
  Defaults to the first locale generated.
- **imports**: An iterable or a single string to add as import to the
  generated file. Defaults to import [`package:meta`][].

### Data Class Generator

This generator creates all-in-one classes directly from the predefined config.

To use this generator, you also need to put [`package:json_converters_lite`][]
under [dependencies][] in your [`pubspec.yaml`][].

```yaml
dependencies:
  json_converters:
```

The config example is the following:

```json
{
  // The name of the class.
  "Address": {
    // The dart name of the class.
    "name": "AddressModel",
    // The doc for the class.
    "doc": "The model of an address.",
    // The properties of each field.
    "fields": {
      "id": {
        "type": "int",
        "default": null,
        "doc": "The identificator of this address.",
        "nullable": true,
        "compare": true
      },
      "postal_code": {
        // The dart name will be this value instead of the field key.
        "name": "postCode",
        "type": "int",
        "default": null,
        "doc": null,
        "nullable": false,
        "compare": false
      },
      "companies": {
        // Implementation of the one-to-many relationship.
        "type": "Company[]",
        "default": [],
        "doc": null,
        "nullable": false
      }
    },
    "instances": {
      "address": {
        "id": 1,
        "postCode": 12345,
        "companies": [
          "company"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  // The name of the other class.
  "Company": {
    // The dart name of the other class.
    "name": "CompanyModel",
    "doc": null,
    "fields": {
      "registry_number": {
        "type": "int",
        "default": null,
        "doc": null,
        "nullable": false,
        "compare": true
      },
      "address_id": {
        "type": "int",
        "default": null,
        "doc": null,
        "nullable": false,
        "compare": false
      },
      "address": {
        // Implementation of the many-to-one relationship.
        "type": "Address",
        "default": null,
        "doc": null,
        "nullable": true
      }
    },
    "instances": {
      "company": {
        "registry_number": 123,
        "address_id": "address.id",
        "address": "address"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The config contains all of the classes to be generated. Each class contains
`fields` key to set the fields of the class, and, optionally, an `instances`
key to create instances of this class from `fields` and their values. Each
class and each field can also contain any of the properties listed below.

The properties of the class may optionally specify:

- **name**: The custom Dart name for the generated class. Defaults to the key
  of the class in the outer layer. If generator `convert` option is also true,
  formats the key to [camel case][camel-case-link], otherwise be sure to pass
  valid Dart name or the generation will be likely to fail.
- **doc**: The documentation for the generated class. If none is specified,
  uses the mock up one.
- **to_json**: If `toJson` and `fromJson` serialization methods should also be
  created for each model. Defaults to `true`.

The properties of each field may optionally specify:

- **type**: The type of the field, works like `Enum`. If specified a square
  brackets at the end, will be an `Iterable` of the same type. For, example:

  ```json
  "type": "int" // will be an integer
  "type": "int[]" // will be an iterable of integers

  "type": "enum" // will raise an error
  "type": "enum[a,b,c]" // will be an Enum
  "type": "flag[a,b,c]" // will be an iterable of Enums
  ```

  Currently, type can be one of the following:

  - _object_,
  - _enum_, which is later generated from it's values in square brackets,
  - _bool_,
  - _int_,
  - _float_, which is converted to `double`,
  - _str_, which is converted to `String`,
  - _datetime_, which is converted to `DateTime`,
  - _timedelta_, which is converted to `Duration`,
  - or other **_data class_** that is being currently generated.

- **name**: The custom Dart name for the generated field. Defaults to the key
  of the field in the middle layer. If generator `convert` option is also true,
  formats the key to [camel case][camel-case-link], otherwise be sure to pass
  valid Dart name or the generation will be likely to fail.
- **doc**: The documentation for the generated field. If none is specified,
  uses the mock up one.
- **default**: The default value of this field. This value should be a
  serialized value of this field's type, which is then deserialized and
  rendered correctly during generation proccess.
- **nullable**: If the field can be nullable. Defaults to `true`.
- **required**: If the field is required. Defaults to `true`, if field has no
  `default` value specified and field is `nullable`.
- **copy**: If the field should be included in `copyWith` or `copyWithNull`
  methods. Defaults to `true`.
- **serialize**: If the field should be included in `toMap` method.
  Defaults to `true`.
- **deserialize**: If the field should be included in `fromMap` method if it is
  not required. Defaults to `true`.
- **compare**: If the field should participate in `compareTo` method
  implementaion. Defaults to `false`.
- **equality**: If the field should be added to `== operator` and `hashCode`.
  Can be a bool or a string of the following values:
  - _none_, if the field should not be added to equality,
  - _ordered (**default**)_, if the equality should be added as
    `IterableEquality` for iterable fields and `== operator` for regular ones,
  - _unordered_, if the equality should be added as
    `UnorderedIterableEquality` for iterable fields and `== operator` for
    regular ones.
- **to_string**: If the field should be added to the `toString` method.
  Defaults to `true`.
- **check_type**: If value type should be checked on `deserialize` and replaced
 for `chek_type_default` if needed. Defaults to `true`.
- **check_type_default**: The default value of this field if `check_type`
  resolves to false. This value should be a serialized value of this field's
  type, which is then deserialized and rendered correctly during generation
  proccess. If no value is specified, the `default` value is used instead.
- **cast_iterable**: If the iterable value `type` should be processed on
  `deserialize` using `Iterable.cast` instead of `Iterable.whereType`.
  Defaults to `false`.

Each of the generated classes has the following parts:

1. **constructor**
2. **fields**
3. **copyWith**, if any of the class fields has `copy` property set to `true`.
4. **copyWithNull**, if any of the class fields has `copy` and `nullable`
   properties set to `true`.
5. **toMap**, if any of the class fields has `serialize` property set to `true`.
6. **fromMap**, if any of the class fields has `serialize` property set to
   `true`.
7. **comparable**, if any of the class fields has `compare` property set to
   `true`.
8. **== operator**
9. **hashCode**
10. **toString**

The way serialization works is by using the [`package:json_converters_lite`][]
for handling serialization of basic fields and custom generated converters for
fields with other data classes. Thus, each generated data class has it's own
converter generated.

Also, if class has had any `Enum` fields specified, these fields are rendered
on their own at the top of the generated file.

The Data Class generator may also have the following keys:

- **import_path**: The path that leads to the file or directory to get the
  info about generated classes from. Defaults to `models`.
- **export_path**: The path that leads to the file that is being generated.
  Defaults to `lib/models.g.dart`.
- **export_encoding**: The encoding used for writing the `.dart` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **encoding**: The encoding used for reading the `.json` and `.yaml` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **convert_field_names**: If the field names should be converted to
  [camel case][camel-case-link]. Disabling this option will prevent any changes
  to be made to the field names. Be certain to pass valid Dart names or the
  generation will be likely to fail. Defaults to `true`.
- **convert_class_names**: If the class names should be converted to
  [camel case][camel-case-link]. Disabling this option will prevent any changes
  to be made to the class names. Be certain to pass valid Dart names or the
  generation will be likely to fail. Defaults to `false`.
- **assign_field_types**: If the unknown field types should be resolved from
  default values. Defaults to `true`.
- **include_null_fields**: If the fields with null values should be added in
  `toMap`. Defaults to `true`.
- **empty_required_iterables**: If the required iterable fields with null values
  should be replaced with empty iterable in `fromMap`. Defaults to `true`.
- **imports**: An iterable or a single string to add as an import to the
  generated file. By default, imports [`package:json_converters_lite`][].

### Icon Fonts Generator

This generator depends on the [fantasticon][fantasticon-link] js package to
generate a [webfont][webfont-link] itself. So, to use this generator, you need
to have [Node.JS][node-js-link] installed on your machine. Apart from that,
it's all the same as the previous ones.

The `.svg` icons are taken recursively from the specified `import_path`. The
initial file structure is preserved and generated as nested classes later.

> NOTE: `.svg` files should be normalized before processing with this generator.
> To do this, you can use tools like [**svgo**][svgo-link]. Unnormalized `.svg`
> may lead to unexpected results including crashes.

To use this generator, you also need to specify generated font in your
[`pubspec.yaml`][].

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Icons
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/icons.ttf
```

You can also reduce the size of your application by removing support for flutter
material icons from your [`pubspec.yaml`][].

```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: false # or remove the line
```

The Icon Fonts generator may also have the following keys:

- **import_path**: The path that leads to the directory to get the `.svg` files
  to generate a webfont from. Defaults to `icons`.
- **export_path**: The path that leads to the file that is being generated.
  Defaults to `lib/icons.g.dart`.
- **font_export_path**: The path that leads to the [`.ttf`][webfont-link] file
  that is being generated. Defaults to `lib/icons.ttf`.
- **export_encoding**: The encoding used for writing the `.dart` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **encoding**: The encoding used for reading the `.json` and `.yaml` files.
  Defaults to `utf-8`.
- **base_name**: The name of the generated class. Defaults to `Icons`.
- **font_family**: The name of the font family specified in the flutter section
  of the [`pubspec.yaml`][]. Defaults to `Icons`.
- **base_code_point**: The number to start listing icons from in the generated
  font. This does not change the font generation, rather the dispayed
  values themselves. Defaults to `0xf101`.
- **height**: The height of the heighest icon. Learn more at the
  [fantasticon][fantasticon-link] options section.
- **descent**: The descent is usefull to fix the font baseline. Learn more at
  the [fantasticon][fantasticon-link] options section. Defaults to `0`.
- **normalize**: If the icons should be normalized by scaling them to the
  height of the highest icon. Learn more at the [fantasticon][fantasticon-link]
  options section. Defaults to `false`.
- **convert**: If the icon names should be converted to
  [camel case][camel-case-link]. Disabling this option will prevent any changes
  to be made to the icon names. Be certain to pass valid Dart names or the
  generation will be likely to fail. Defaults to `true`.
- **package**: The js package to run `npm install` or `yarn install` with.
  Should be a valid path to a file with a package if running this generator
  from console. Defaults to package with `fantasticon: ^1.2.3`.
- **yarn**: If `yarn` should be used instead of `npm`. Defaults to `false`.
- **force**: If the `package` should be installed forcefully. Otherwise, if
  `fantasticon` executable is present, installation is ommited.
  Defaults to `false`.

## FAQ

### Why another project when all of these generators already exist?

While there are many different projects with the same goal of generating Dart
code, there is none of them, that feature all mainly used generators in the
same package, codebase, unified usage and resulting code.

That's why this is an attempt to make things easier, more convenient and better
quality for the end user.

### Is it safe to use in production?

Yes, but with caution. Some use-cases may not be as simple as they could be.

But overall, you should be able to use these generators without any trouble.

### Will a new generators be added over time?

Of course they will!
